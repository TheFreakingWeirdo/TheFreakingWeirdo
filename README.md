Hi, Iâ€™m @TheFreakingWeirdo

I am a code enthusiast that likes to fiddle with code. 
By no means I am a professional programmer, hence I dedicate some of my spare time to this crazy and fascinating world that is working with software. 
Either way, even if I am an amateur, I am very eager to learn more about code and to create something cool with the tools that programming offers me.
My main knowledge on programming is concentrated in web development (mainly HTML, CSS), but I have worked a little bit with PHP and SQL.
