Hi, Iâ€™m @TheFreakingWeirdo

I am a code enthusiast that likes to fiddle with code. 
By no means I am a professional programmer, yet I dedicate some of my spare time to this crazy and fascinating world that is working with software. 
Either way, even if I am an amateur, I am very eager to learn more about code and to create something cool with the tools that programming offers me.
I am mostly used to web development, mainly HTML, CSS; and have also worked a little bit with PHP and SQL.
